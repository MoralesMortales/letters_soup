## What's this?
It's a website able to create letters soups and save them on PDF format, moreover, the soups created can be saved on the Django DB to see all the previous soups that the current user had created.

### How does It work?

It's straightforward, once the user go to the website the first view is the Letters Soup Creator, and here any soup can be created even without an account; that's because the account allows the history funtionality.
